**Note: this syntax highlighting file is now [shipped with GtkSourceView](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtksourceview/commit/?id=db965e3a) since version 3.9.2.**

## Overview

gedit-mediawiki adds [MediaWiki](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Editing) syntax highlighting in gedit, the default Gnome text editor.

Here's a screenshot:

## Installation

- [Download the archive of the latest version.](https://github.com/jpfleury/gedit-mediawiki/archive/master.zip)

- Extract the archive.

- Copy the file `mediawiki.lang` in one of the following two locations (create the folder if it doesn't yet exist):

	- for gedit 2: `~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/`
	- for gedit 3: `~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/`

MediaWiki syntax highlighting will be added for the current user (so no need root privileges). The folder created by the extraction can be deleted after installation.

## Uninstallation

Remove the file previously installed.

## Usage

First of all, restart gedit if it's already running.

Choose syntax highlighting by going to *View > Highlight Mode > Others* and selecting *MediaWiki*.

The folder `doc` contains a demo file.
